Steps after creation of resources to test:

Test connection to storage account:
1. Go to storage account > networking > add your IP to transfer a file
2. Go to blob container and create a SAS token (read, write, list)
3. Upload the hello_world.html to the container from repo documentation
4. Log into VMSS instance
5. Copy file back to storage with a new name (replace <SAS token> with the previously created token:

sudo azcopy copy "https://vmssdatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/vmss-container/hello_world.html?<SAS token>" "https://vmssdatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/vmss-container/hello_world_copy.html?<SAS TOKEN>"


Test SQL connection:
1. Log into VM
2. Run the following commands:

echo 'export PATH="$PATH:/opt/mssql-tools/bin"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

sqlcmd -S data-snt-sql-server.database.windows.net -U michael -P <PASSWORD> -d datadb -Q "SELECT @@VERSION"
