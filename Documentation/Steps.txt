Steps after creation of resources to test:


Test connection to storage account:

# go to blob container and create a SAS token (read, write, list)
# upload the hello_world.html to the container from repo documentation
# log into VMSS instance

# copy file back to storage with a new name
sudo azcopy copy "https://vmssdatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/vmss-container/hello_world.html?<SAS token>" "https://vmssdatastorage.blob.core.windows.net/vmss-container/hello_world_copy.html?<SAS TOKEN>"


# Test SQL connection:
add LB Pub ip to rules (sqlserver>security>networking>add a firewall rule)
the IP that the sql server FW sees is the Pub IP of the LB that is associated with the VMSS
sqlcmd -S data-snt-sql-server.database.windows.net -U michael -P gfbrDFG534@grg12 -d datadb -Q "SELECT @@VERSION"
